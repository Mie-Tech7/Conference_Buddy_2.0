> Build error occurred
Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
./app
Invalid import
'client-only' cannot be imported from a Server Component module. It should only be used from a Client Component.
The error was caused by using 'styled-jsx'. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.
